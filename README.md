## COLOR BLOCKS
Color blocks is an web application that I built in my first week in the classroom at Prime. This application starts with four buttons and a counter for each color at the top of the page.  Each time a button is clicked, a block will appear of the appropriate color and the counter for that color will increment by one. Clicking the color-block will delete the block and subtract one from the appropriate color.

To view this app clone the repository and open the file path in a web browser.
